## üß≠ Overview

This project forecasts monthly residential gas consumption in California using three time series models: **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, and **ETS**. The models are compared based on forecast accuracy and statistical validity of residuals to identify the most appropriate forecasting method.

## ‚ùì Research Question

> Which time series model (ARIMA, SARIMA, or ETS) provides the most accurate and statistically reliable forecasts of monthly residential gas consumption in California?

---

## üìä Dataset

- **Source:** [U.S. EIA - California Natural Gas Consumption](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n3010ca2m.htm)  
- **Period:** January 1989 - September 2024 (monthly)  
- **Unit:** Million Cubic Feet (MCF)  
- **Missing data:** One missing value (January 2024) imputed with the historical January mean

---

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Trend:** Growth until early 2000s, then stabilization  
- **Seasonality:** Strong annual cycles - higher in winter, lower in summer  
- **Distribution:** Right-skewed, long-tailed (skewness = 0.73)  
- **Stationarity:** ADF and KPSS tests confirmed the need for seasonal differencing  
- **ACF/PACF:** Clear seasonal autocorrelation at lag 12

---

## üîÑ Log Transformation

- A **log transformation** was applied to reduce heteroscedasticity and stabilize variance.  
- It improved stationarity and helped satisfy normality assumptions required for ARIMA modeling.  
- After forecasting on the **log scale**, all predicted values were **back-transformed using the exponential function** to evaluate performance in the original scale (MCF).  
- This back-transformation was essential for interpreting the results meaningfully and computing accuracy metrics like MAE and RMSE.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modeling (Forecast Horizon: Oct 2023 ‚Äì Sep 2024)

All models were trained on data up to **September 2023** and used to forecast the next 12 months, from **October 2023 to September 2024**.

### üîπ ARIMA(2,0,1) - Baseline
- Built on log-transformed data without seasonal terms  
- Forecasted 12 months ahead (Oct 2023 - Sep 2024)  
- **Purpose:** Serve as a benchmark for non-seasonal performance  
- **Result:** MAPE = 20.86%, residual autocorrelation and skewness

### üîπ SARIMA(2,0,1)(0,1,1)[12] - Auto Selected
- Applied on log scale with seasonal differencing  
- Forecasted 12 months ahead (Oct 2023 - Sep 2024)  
- **Purpose:** Capture seasonal patterns using `auto.arima()` with drift  
- **Result:** MAPE = 6.48%, Theil‚Äôs U = 0.49, passed Ljung-Box but **failed Jarque-Bera** test

### üîπ ETS(M,N,A) - Exponential Smoothing
- Multiplicative error model with additive seasonality  
- Forecasted 12 months ahead (Oct 2023 ‚Äì Sep 2024)  
- **Purpose:** Provide a robust benchmark from a different modeling family  
- **Result:** MAPE = 5.56%, lowest forecast error, but failed both **Ljung-Box** and **Jarque-Bera** tests

## üß™ Model Evaluation

| Metric           | ARIMA(2,0,1) | SARIMA(2,0,1)(0,1,1)[12] | ETS(M,N,A) | **Rel. Error vs Mean (%)** |
|------------------|--------------|---------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| **MAPE** (%)     | 20.86        | 6.48                      | **5.56**   | -                           |
| **RMSE** (MCF)   | 8,337        | 5,071                     | **4,293**  | -                           |
| **MAE** (MCF)    | 6,851        | 2,725                     | **2,321**  | 17.1 / 6.8 / **5.8**         |
| **ACF1**         | 0.25         | -0.31                     | -0.53      | -                           |
| **Ljung-Box**    | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ                        | ‚ùå         | -                           |
| **Jarque-Bera**  | ‚ùå           | ‚ùå                        | ‚ùå         | -                           |

**MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values  
**RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Penalizes larger errors more than MAE  
**MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Expresses forecast error as a % of actual values  
**ACF1**: Lag-1 autocorrelation of residuals (ideally near zero)  
**Rel. Error vs Mean**: MAE divided by the mean gas consumption (‚âà 40,053 MCF) √ó 100% - shows model error relative to average monthly usage

## ‚úÖ Forecast Comparison

- Forecasts were made for the **last 12 months of available data: October 2023 ‚Äì September 2024**
- Models were trained on log-transformed data and **back-transformed to original scale** for error comparison.
- While ETS yielded the **lowest MAPE**, its residuals showed autocorrelation and deviation from normality.
- SARIMA balanced accuracy with stronger statistical diagnostics, despite failing the Jarque-Bera normality test.
- The basic ARIMA model lacked seasonality and underperformed in both accuracy and residual checks.

## üìå Results Interpretation

Descriptive statistics for the original gas consumption data (in million cubic feet):

- **Min:** 15,058  
- **Max:** 88,358  
- **Mean:** 40,053  
- **Median:** 32,935  

### üîé Why we use Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive stats provide a **reference point** for evaluating the scale of forecast errors. For example:

- **ETS MAE = 2,321 MCF**, which is just **5.8% of the mean** - indicating very accurate forecasts.
- Errors also cover a small portion of the data range (~73,300 MCF), suggesting the models are not wildly off even at their worst.

‚úÖ **Conclusion:** Both SARIMA and ETS models provide strong forecasts for monthly gas consumption in California. ETS is most accurate, but SARIMA offers the best balance of accuracy and residual reliability.
