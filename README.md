## üß≠ Overview

This project forecasts monthly residential gas consumption in California using three time series models: **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, and **ETS**. The models are compared based on forecast accuracy and statistical validity of residuals to identify the most appropriate forecasting method.

---

## üß™ Technologies

- **Language:** R  
- **Libraries:** `forecast`, `ggplot2`, `tseries`, `urca`, `TSA`, `FinTS`, `DescTools`, `fUnitRoots`, `patchwork`, `dplyr`

## ‚ùì Research Question

> Which time series model (ARIMA, SARIMA, or ETS) provides the most accurate and statistically reliable forecasts of monthly residential gas consumption in California?

---

## üìä Dataset

- **Source:** [U.S. EIA - California Natural Gas Consumption](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n3010ca2m.htm)  
- **Period:** January 1989 ‚Äì September 2024 (monthly)  
- **Unit:** Million Cubic Feet (MCF)  
- **Missing data:** One missing value (January 2024) imputed with the historical January mean

---

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Trend:** Growth until early 2000s, then stabilization  
- **Seasonality:** Strong annual cycles ‚Äî higher in winter, lower in summer  
- **Distribution:** Right-skewed, long-tailed (skewness = 0.73)  
- **Stationarity:** ADF and KPSS tests confirmed the need for seasonal differencing  
- **ACF/PACF:** Clear seasonal autocorrelation at lag 12

---

## üîÑ Log Transformation

- A **log transformation** was applied to reduce heteroscedasticity and stabilize variance.  
- It improved stationarity and helped satisfy normality assumptions required for ARIMA modeling.  
- After forecasting on the **log scale**, all predicted values were **back-transformed using the exponential function** to evaluate performance in the original scale (MCF).  
- This back-transformation was essential for interpreting the results meaningfully and computing accuracy metrics like MAE and RMSE.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modeling

### üîπ ARIMA(2,0,2) ‚Äî Baseline
- Built on log-transformed data without seasonal terms.  
- **Purpose:** Serve as a benchmark for non-seasonal performance.  
- **Result:** MAPE = 20.86%, significant residual autocorrelation.

### üîπ SARIMA(2,0,1)(0,1,1)[12] ‚Äî Auto Selected
- Applied on log scale with seasonal differencing.  
- **Purpose:** Capture seasonal patterns using `auto.arima()` with drift.  
- **Result:** MAPE = 6.48%, Theil‚Äôs U = 0.49, passed all residual diagnostics.

### üîπ ETS(M,N,A) ‚Äî Exponential Smoothing
- Multiplicative error model with additive seasonality.  
- **Purpose:** Provide a robust benchmark from a different modeling family.  
- **Result:** MAPE = 5.56%, lowest forecast error, but failed Ljung-Box and Jarque-Bera tests.

## ‚úÖ Forecast Comparison

- Forecasts were generated on the **log scale** and **back-transformed** for evaluation in original units.
- While ETS yielded the **lowest MAPE**, its residuals violated independence and normality assumptions.
- SARIMA offered strong accuracy **and** clean residual diagnostics ‚Äî making it the **most balanced and reliable model**.
- The basic ARIMA model lacked seasonality and underperformed as expected.

## üìå Results Interpretation

Descriptive statistics for the original gas consumption data (in million cubic feet):

- **Min:** 15,058  
- **Max:** 88,358  
- **Mean:** 40,053  
- **Median:** 32,935  

### üîé Comparing Forecast Errors to Data Scale

| Model   | MAE   | RMSE  | MAPE   |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| SARIMA  | 2,725 | 5,071 | 6.48%  |
| ETS     | 2,321 | 4,293 | 5.56%  |

- The **ETS model's MAE** is about **5.8% of the mean** and just **2.6% of the data range** ‚Äî a strong result.
- **SARIMA** performs nearly as well in error metrics and **adds statistical validity** (i.e., reliable uncertainty estimation).
- **MAPE under 7%** is generally considered excellent in real-world forecasting.

‚úÖ **Conclusion:** Both SARIMA and ETS models deliver high-quality forecasts. SARIMA is preferred for its overall **balance between accuracy and diagnostics**.
